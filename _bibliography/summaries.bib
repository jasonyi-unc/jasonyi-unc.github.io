  abstract      = {We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that
                   models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and
                   semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to
                   model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states
                   of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large
                   text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing
                   models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging
                   NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment
                   analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals
                   of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix
                   different types of semi-supervision signals.},

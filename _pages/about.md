I'm Jason Yi, and I work with Full-Stack Development in the Account Opening team at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) using GraphQL and Angular. I'm a rising junior at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu) double majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and Statistics and Analytics (B.S.)

At UNC-Chapel Hill, I am an incoming Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [STOR RTG Network Research Group](https://networks-pods-rtg.unc.edu/) under [Professor Fraiman](https://fraiman.web.unc.edu/) focusing on Synchronization Algorithms. I was also an Undergaduate TA for COMP 210 (Data Structures) and (hopefully) an incoming TA for COMP 550 (Algorithms).

My interests lie in low-latency development, operating systems, machine learning, and algorithms. I am currently reading [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://beefnoodles.cc/assets/book/C++%20Concurrency%20in%20Action.pdf) and listening to podcasts like [Signals and Threads](https://signalsandthreads.com/) by Jane Street. I'm always happy to have a conversation about these topics to gain new perspectives.

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, library hopping, taking long walks, weightlifting, solving problems, and watching clips of Suits on YouTube. I used to draw portraits and anatomy in high school competitively. A fun fact about me is that I studied abroad at South Korea in Summer 2023 at Yonsei University where I met my mom's relatives for the first time.
